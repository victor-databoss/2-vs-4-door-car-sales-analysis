# 2-vs-4-door-car-sales-analysisAnalysis of car features and trends by door type using Excel.
# Project Overview
This project analyzes the differences between 2-door and 4-door cars using an automotive dataset. The goal is to understand how features like price, horsepower, fuel efficiency, and engine size vary with the number of doors, and which type might be more appealing to different consumers.
